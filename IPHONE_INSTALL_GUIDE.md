- âœ… **Fullscreen** - no Safari browser interface
- âœ… **Offline support** - works without internet for cached content

## ðŸ”§ Testing Locally First

If you want to test before deploying:

```bash
cd "/Users/sonamjsherpa/Desktop/Roster-Hub copy/client"
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then:
1. **On iPhone**: Connect to same WiFi as your computer
2. **Open Safari**: Go to `http://[YOUR_COMPUTER_IP]:4173`
3. **Follow the install steps** above

**Note**: Local testing has limitations - full PWA features only work on HTTPS (live deployment).

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Works

Your RosterHub app is now a **Progressive Web App** with:
- **Web App Manifest** - tells iOS how to install it
- **Service Worker** - handles offline functionality and caching
- **Responsive Design** - looks great on iPhone
- **App-like experience** - behaves like a native app

Once installed, your users can access RosterHub just like any other app on their iPhone! ðŸŽ‰
